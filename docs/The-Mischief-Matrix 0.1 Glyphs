Abuse:
In the 20th century, the swastika was co-opted by the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler as a symbol of racial supremacy, hate, and the oppression of millions. The Nazis twisted its ancient meaning to represent their ideology of white supremacy, violence, and destruction, permanently tainting its reputation in the West.

Abuse:
The pentagram has often been associated with dark practices, such as Satanism and occultism, especially in the modern era.

Abuse:
The symbol was co-opted by the Nazis and associated with their occult beliefs, particularly by SS officer Heinrich Himmler, who used the Black Sun to represent Aryan mysticism and the idea of an ideal, pure race. This twisted version of the symbol has since been linked to neo-Nazi groups, further distorting its ancient meaning and turning it into a symbol of hate and extreme nationalism.

Abuse:
